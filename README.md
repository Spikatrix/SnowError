    cd SnowError
    yarn install
    yarn start  # Fails

    We'll prepare this package for you now, but should add "@apollo/client/core" to "knownEntrypoints"
    in your config file so that this gets prepared with the rest of your imports during startup.

Running `yarn build` and running the built application works just fine without any issues
